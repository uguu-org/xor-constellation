Xor Constellation

+ Append XOR operands to expression until resulting byte is 0x00 or 0xff.
+ Either 0x00 or 0xff will clear the chain, but more points is scored if it's the same result as the last chain.
+ Normal mode = 8 bits, easy mode = 4 bits
+ Tiles that would have been 0x00 are drawn with a special sprite instead.
+ Each tile contains a single operand for XOR.
+ Maximum chain is 24.

+ Game ends when player runs out of thinking time.
+ Thinking time decreases at a rate proportional to amount of idleness.  We want 30 seconds of consecutive idleness to end the game right away, but give players ~2 seconds of thinking time for a ~10 minute game.

10 minutes of thinking time = 5 minutes zero cost time + 5 minutes rated time
- 5 minutes time at 1x = 30 seconds at variable rate.
- Rate of thinking time decrease is proportional to amount of idleness.  Idle time can be computed from last_action_timestamp.
- First second of idleness costs no time.


Title screen should have white background, since start of game will have all targets flashing white.


 

Crank/left/right = set direction.
A/up = go forward.
B/down = undo.

Initialization:
1. Set starting tile so that XOR with any neighbor tile does not result in 0x00 or 0xff (i.e. minimum chain is at least 3 tiles).
2. Perform a random walk of at least 3 steps from starting tile, making sure that intermediate XOR results are not 0x00 nor 0xff.
3. Modify one random tile along the chain to make the XOR result 0xFF, excluding the ones directly adjacent to starting tile.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for 0x00.

On completing a chain: randomize all tiles along current chain, then repeat initialization steps.

Scoring:
+ Add 1<<length points for each completed chain.
+ Increase bonus multiplier if XOR result is same as previous (i.e. bonus for repeated 0x0 or 0xf).
+ Bonus multiplier for including Bocchi or Kita in the chain.
